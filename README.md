# kanata-tray

A simple wrapper for [kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata) to control it from tray icon. 
Should work on Windows and Linux.

## Features

- Tray icon with buttons for starting/stopping kanata
- Easy switching between multiple kanata configurations and versions.
- Works out-of-the box with no configuration, but can be configured with toml file.

## Configuration

Default config will be autogenerated for you on the first run. 
You can access it from from: `Click Tray Icon > Options`. 
On Linux config folder is usually located in `~/.config/kanata-tray/config.toml`. 
On Windows it's usually `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\kanata-tray\config.toml`

An example of customized configuration file:

```toml
# default: []
configurations = [
    "~/.config/kanata/kanata.kbd",
    "~/.config/kanata/test.kbd",
]

# default: []
executables = [
    "~/.config/kanata/kanata", 
    "~/.config/kanata/kanata-debug",
]

[layer_icons]
base = "hello.ico" 
qwerty = "qwerty.ico"
"*" = "other_layers.ico"

[general]
include_executables_from_system_path = false # default: true
include_configs_from_default_locations = false # default: true
launch_on_start = true # default: true
```

Notes:
- You can use `~` in paths to substitute to your "home" directory.
- `layer_icons` maps kanata layer names to custom icons. Custom icons should be placed in `icons` folder in config directory, next to `config.toml`. Accepted icon types on Linux are `.ico`, `.png`, `.jpg`; on Windows only `.ico` is supported. You can assign an icon to special identifier `"*"` to change icon for other layers not specified in `[layer_icons]`.
- On Windows, when providing paths, you need to replace every `\` character with `\\`. Example: `C:\\Users\\<User1\\Desktop\\kanata.kbd`.

Notes about autorun:
- If `configurations` is non-empty, the first item from it will be launched at start.
- Otherwise it falls back to a first kanata configs found by `include_configs_from_default_locations` option, if enabled.
- Otherwise, if no configs available, it won't auto-launch anything.
- Similar thing applies to kanata executables (see options `executables` and `include_executables_from_system_path`)
